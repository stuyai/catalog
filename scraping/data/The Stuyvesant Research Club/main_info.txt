Mission:
The Research Club aims to provide students with a community to explore their scientific curiosities and resources to get involved in research.

Meeting Schedule:
Research Club general meetings are typically held on Fridays. Each SIGMA department holds a meeting at least once every 2-3 weeks and each department has its own designated weekday to meet that does not overlap with that of other departments. SRMP meetings are held twice a month, in addition to one-on-one meetings with a mentor as needed. Notation recording sessions are every other week.
