Mission:
STC aims to produce three entirely student-led shows per year, one per season, to foster a love of theater within our school community.

Meeting Schedule:
While STC has three high-commitment seasons (Fall, Winter and Spring), participation in all is not required, and members can choose their level of involvement. Rehearsals and crew meetings are generally held on every school day of a production cycle, which lasts from 4-6 weeks every Fall, Winter and Spring. Before each cycle, there are two weeks of pre-production, including one week during which Cast Directors and Producers are chosen, and one week of auditions/crew recruitments. 2-4 weekend rehearsals are held per show, usually lasting for the length of two or more rehearsals, and taking place on one day of the weekend. For each crew, it is at the discretion of the directors which crew members are needed on certain days, so commitment varies based on crew and role in said crew. While daily rehearsals will usually last around two hours, during each productionâ€™s three show days, performers and technical crew members will be expected to stay later into the evenings.
