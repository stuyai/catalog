Mission:
The Stuyvesant Board Games Club is dedicated to the playing and teaching of a wide range of board and tabletop games.

Meeting Schedule:
We meet Tuesdays and Fridays throughout the year. If we are off from school on those days, we may reschedule meetings to the nearest available date. Meetings will always be held on Fridays, Tuesday is subject to change as we observe club attendance. If attendance is low on Tuesdays, we might call off Tuesday meetings or pick a different day to hold meetings depending on our club members' availability. 

Online meetings may occur based on leadership discretion.
