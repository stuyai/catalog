Mission:
StuyOrienteers is Stuy's orienteering team. We aim to educate people in and provide opportunities to compete in the sport of orienteering.

Meeting Schedule:
Our meeting schedule depends largely on when events are happening and will vary throughout the year, but generally, there will be more meetings during the fall and especially spring, and less during the winter. Meetings will generally be once or twice a week, with optional weekend practices and events as much as possible.
