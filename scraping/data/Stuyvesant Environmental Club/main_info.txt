Mission:
The SEC works to promote positive environmental action in the Stuy community through recycling, gardening, upcycling, educational events, and more!

Meeting Schedule:
We have 1-2 mandatory clubwide meetings every semester (including the Earth Day Fair). Outside of those meetings, members will be required to participate in some club meetings for at least 4 hours every marking period. Our club requirements can be found here:https://stuyenviro.weebly.com/club-requirements.html. 

Meetings are held weekly by the Gardening, Green Team, and Research branches. Gardening meetings allow members to maintain potted plants and a hydroponics wall in school. Green Team meetings allow members to do arts and crafts via upcycling projects. Research meetings allow members to practice informative article writing, as well as to do research of their own. All meetings are open to all members - feel free to go to whichever meetings most interest you!

Outside of regularly scheduled meetings, we also host events regularly. Some are virtual webinars over Zoom; some are in-person speaker events; some are in-person volunteering events. Check in regularly for event times!
