Mission:
The key mission of this club is to encourage students to pursue occupations in the creative field and spread awareness of diverse cultures.

Meeting Schedule:
Our meeting schedule is consistently on Mondays and Wednesdays. However, the bulk of the meetings are on Mondays, so if you can't make it on Wednesdays consistently, that isn't a problem as long as you show up consistently on Mondays! But, there's a catch: Commitment to attending both days of the week will play a role in deciding leadership roles.

Leaders:
Richi Mozumder - President (Founder)
Veronika Gulko - Co- Vice President
Violetta Razdolska - Co- Vice President
Pasqua Rocchio - Faculty Advisor
