Mission:
CCTV (Closed-Circuit Television) is dedicated to producing high-quality video content for both Stuyvesant High School and CCTV's own films/productions

Meeting Schedule:
CCTV will host approximately an average 10-15 meetings every month. Though, this is a total for all meetings. On many instances, some roles may not be needed during a specific meeting while others are. Members should have a relatively open schedule so they are able to make the meetings in which they are needed. In the event a member is unable to make it to the meeting, a replacement will be found. For members that are on camera and have a role in the film itself, they must make the Cast Coordinator aware of this so the meeting can be rescheduled.

The amount of meetings in a month will be lower if there are school breaks/vacations. CCTV will not be active or host any meetings during the summer.
