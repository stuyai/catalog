Mission:
The Stuyvesant Genshin Impact Club aims to connect and destress students through Genshin Impact, an open-world RPG with gacha elements.

Meeting Schedule:
Our meeting schedule will definitely vary, but we aim to meet at least once a week on Mondays, because that is when weekly aspects of the game reset. There may be more meetings when there are events, especially those that encourage co-op, and when there are new banners, so that all members can celebrate when new characters are available.

Leaders:
Renxuan Pang
Elisa Chan
