Mission:
Stuyvesant Filipino Club aims to foster a positive and welcoming community for both Filipinos and non-Filipinos to celebrate the culture.

Meeting Schedule:
Our meeting schedule varies depending on school-sanctioned events and testing, but we will meet at least twice a month (typically on Thursdays), with a special event such as a charity concert or karaoke night at least once a month. Attendance is not mandatory, but is much appreciated!
