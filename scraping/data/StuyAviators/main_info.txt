Mission:
StuyAviators aims to unite those who have an interest in aviation and give them a preliminary introduction to the aviation industry.

Meeting Schedule:
Members of StuyAviators will gather together at least once a month to hang out and have fun. Meetings can either be in person or online depending on the availability of the majority of members. We aim to host in person meetings on Fridays after 10th period, and online meetings will generally be held when members request them and we reach the minimum quota for students able to attend. During these meetings (depending on whether in-person or online), we may hang out, chat, do presentations, play aviation games, etc. We may even host flight simulations inside the classroom from time to time.
