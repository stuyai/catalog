Mission:
In the STTRPG Club, our members will learn to one day play D&D, and other such RPGs, to alleviate after school stress.

Meeting Schedule:
All members of the club will be sorted into individual campaigns run by different dungeon masters. Different campaigns will have different meeting schedules, as some groups may wish to meet more than once a week, while other groups would feel more comfortable with a casual schedule of one meeting every two weeks. Each DM decides how often their group will meet, and the prospective players can sign up for the campaign they feel best fits their schedule. There will be at least one group that meets twice a week and at least one that meets once a week.
