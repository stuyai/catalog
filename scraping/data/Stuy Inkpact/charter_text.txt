What is the meeting schedule?:
Our meeting schedule varies depending on the section you join but we will meet try to meet around twice a week. Some meetings may be held on zoom if we don't have as many things to do.

What is the purpose of this activity?:
The purpose of Stuy Inkpact is to teach people about social justice through art. They will do this through a monthly magazine and different teaching sessions and speaker events at various schools. Stuy Inkpact will host bi-weekly meetings in which members will work in one of four different departments. The four departments are the Teaching Department, Publication Department, External Communications Department, and the Financial Department. The purpose of the Teaching Department is to go to different schools and teach students about the relationship between social justice and art. During weekly meetings, they will work on lesson plans for their next class and work with different schools to find topics that will resonate with their students. The purpose of the Publication Department is to work on The Inkpact, our monthly magazine that goes over different social justice movements using art. They will write articles and interviews as well as publish art and photographs. The purpose of the External Communcations Department is to find different artists in the social justice movement and try to organize speaker events or interviews with them. They will also work with the Financial Department to try to find sponsors to help us get our magazine as physical copies. The purpose of the Financial Department is to find ways to fund our projects that will allow us to reach as many people as possible.

How does this activity benefit Stuyvesant?:
Stuy Inkpact is a highly valuable initiative that provides numerous benefits to the Stuyvesant High School community. One of the key benefits is that it raises awareness about important social justice issues among students. This helps to create a more informed and socially responsible student body that is better equipped to engage with complex challenges facing the world today. Additionally, Stuy Inkpact provides younger students from other schools with an opportunity to learn about these issues and become more engaged in social justice advocacy.
Another great benefit of Stuy Inkpact is that it integrates art and social justice education in a unique and meaningful way. Stuyvesant students are taught about the intersection of art and social justice, which requires extensive research on relevant topics and effective collaboration with younger students. This kind of interdisciplinary learning helps students to develop a broader perspective on social justice issues and deepen their understanding of the role their art and voices can play in creating positive change in the world. 
Moreover, Stuy Inkpact provides a platform for Stuyvesant students to develop their writing skills and become more eloquent writers. By contributing to the magazine, students are able to hone their writing skills and learn how to effectively communicate complex ideas to a broader audience. This, in turn, enables Stuyvesant students to find their voice and express themselves more effectively in their classrooms and beyond. Overall, Stuy Inkpact is an invaluable resource that enriches the Stuyvesant community and helps to create informed and engaged citizens.

How does this activity appoint leaders?:
Every year, applications and interviews for next yearâ€™s leadership positions will be released in the spring. If you are accepted, you will then be trained in order to ensure a smooth transition into the next year. The different positions are 2 Co-Presidents (who apply together), 2 Co-Vice Presidents (who apply together) a Financial President and Vice President, an External Communications President and Vice President, a Publication President and Vice President, and a Teaching President and Vice President. Once you have been accepted as a Co-presidents or Co-Vice Presidents, you stay in your position until you step down, get impeached, or graduate. Once you have been accepted as a department president, you stay in your position until the next school year begins. To impeach a department president, you need 75% of the club members to agree including one person in a leadership position. If a department president is impeached, the vice president of that department will take over and if a vice president is impeached, the leaders will have members apply to replace them. If one Co-President or Co-Vice President is impeached, then both of the Co-Presidents or Co-Vice Presidents are expected to step out of office. To impeach Co-Presidents or Co-Vice Presidents, you need 75% percent of members to agree and 75% of the leaders to agree. The Co-Presidents will have final say in all matters but are expected to listen to thoughts and opinions of fellow leaders and members of the club. All department presidents are expected to make all meetings unless they have a valid reason to be unable to come. The Co-Presidents and Co-Vice Presidents are also expected to make all meetings and if they are unable to attend for reasons other than an illness, they must notify the other leaders at least 24 hours in advance. All members are expected to come to at least one meeting a week and if for some reason, this is not possible, they should speak to the Co-Presidents.

What makes this activity unique?:
Stuy Inkpact is a one-of-a-kind club that brings together two seemingly unrelated topics - art and community service. The club provides a platform for students to hone their art skills while also making a positive impact in their community. Members of Stuy Inkpact engage in various artistic activities such as painting, sculpting, and photography, and use their skills to create content that raises awareness about social issues and promotes community service. Through their work, the club members not only improve their artistic abilities but also develop a sense of responsibility towards their community.
