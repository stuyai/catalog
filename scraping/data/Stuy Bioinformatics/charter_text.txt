Mission Statement:
Stuy Bioinformatics creates a space where students express their interests and publish articles on the applications of computer science in biology.

What days does this organization meet?:
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday

What is the meeting schedule?:
Meeting dates are based off of the availability of the members and can occur on any day of the week. In person or virtual meetings will often be held two to four times a month but can vary.

What is the purpose of this activity?:
Stuy Bioinformatics focuses on bridging the gap between the life and computational sciences, aiming to provide a platform for students to explore and engage in the fascinating world of bioinformatics.
The club's primary objective is to foster a passion for bioinformatics among our members and equip them with the necessary knowledge and skills to excel in this field. Through a variety of activities and projects, it will delve into the fundamental principles and techniques of bioinformatics, enabling students to comprehend the complex relationships between biological data and computational analysis.
One key aspect of the club will be the analysis of large data sets. Bioinformatics involves working with vast amounts of biological data, such as genomic sequences, protein structures, and gene expression profiles. Through workshops and hands-on projects, members will learn how to extract meaningful information from these datasets, identify patterns, and gain insights into biological processes.
Another important area of focus is the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the field of biology. Students will have the opportunity to explore the potential of neural networks and other AI algorithms in analyzing biological data. They will learn how to train AI models using generated data, enabling them to make predictions, classify data, and contribute to cutting-edge research in fields like genomics, proteomics, and drug discovery.
Stuy Bioinformatics is committed to promoting collaboration and teamwork among its members. Bioinformatics is inherently interdisciplinary, requiring expertise from various domains. Therefore, students from diverse backgrounds, including physics, chemistry, and computer science, are encouraged to join the club. Through group projects and discussions, members will learn to leverage their individual strengths and work collectively to tackle complex problems in bioinformatics.
Furthermore, the club will constantly work towards establishing connections with professionals and researchers in the field. By inviting guest speakers and organizing field trips, a myriad of opportunities will be provided for students to learn from experts and gain insights into the latest advancements and applications in bioinformatics.
Students are expected to learn, collaborate, and contribute to the monthly article publication as well as possibly join one of the three departments.

How does this activity benefit Stuyvesant?:
Stuy Bioinformatics allows students to grow and expand their interests while also immersing themselves in the practical use in the field. By engaging in bioinformatics activities, students will expand their knowledge beyond traditional classroom subjects, developing a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of biology with other sciences. This interdisciplinary approach can enhance their overall scientific literacy and critical thinking skills.
Bioinformatics is a rapidly growing field with abundant career opportunities. Through the club, students can gain exposure to potential career paths in bioinformatics, genomics, pharmaceutical research, or data science. This exposure can help them make informed decisions about their future academic and professional pursuits.
Participating in bioinformatics projects and workshops will equip students with valuable technical skills. They will learn to work with cutting edge software and tools to practice their skills and experience. These skills are transferable to various scientific and technological domains and can enhance students' competitiveness in college applications and future careers.
The club's emphasis on collaboration and teamwork will foster a sense of community among members. Students from different academic backgrounds will have the opportunity to learn from and support each other, enhancing their communication, teamwork, and leadership skills. This collaborative environment can also encourage peer mentoring and the exchange of ideas, benefiting the overall school culture.
Bioinformatics research projects will also be conducted, whether it be by individual students or club-wide through the establishing of connections with labs and/or resources within the school. Students may explore novel applications of bioinformatics techniques, analyze real-world data, and generate new insights. This research can contribute to the school's scientific reputation and potentially lead to presentations at science fairs, conferences, or publication opportunities.
Stuy Bioinformatics will engage with the broader community by organizing outreach programs and workshops. Students can share their knowledge and passion for bioinformatics with younger students or community members who may not have been exposed to this field. This outreach can inspire others to pursue STEM-related fields and promote science education within the local community.

How does this activity appoint leaders?:
There is one President role, which will be decided through election. This person is tasked with overseeing the entire club and organizing the activities of the three departments while also managing social media and connecting with professionals. 1-3 Vice Presidents may also be present, who are also elected and assist the President in their duties. The club is divided into three departments: Meetings, Editing, and Web Design, which in each a Director is elected to oversee the members. Meetings organizes the meetings of the club as well as manages activities such as guest speakers and collaborations with other clubs. Editing suggests topics for articles that members write and also revises these articles (e.g. grammar conventions, conciseness). Web Design maintains and adds new features to the publication website while also fixing bugs that members report. 
General members may choose not to join any department, in which case the only expectations are to attend meetings and write articles. Articles are usually published monthly, but deadlines are flexible to an extent and may change based on the workload of members.
All members of the club, including Directors, Vice Presidents, and the President are expected to write articles.
Directors and Vice Presidents are elected every semester while the President remains in the position until they graduate, after which the next candidate is elected. A person can be reelected as many times as they wish to run, but they will be barred from doing so if manipulation or foul play is suspected. 
Leaders who do not fulfill their responsibilities or attempt power overreach will be impeached through popular vote by the members, after which an early election for the next person to fill the position will occur.

What makes this activity unique?:
There is currently no club that focuses specifically on the use of computer science methods to study biological data; as such, the club will greatly benefit the depth of students' knowledge in both subjects as well as provide research opportunities and ideas. The club will also more particularly expand on the applications of generative AI and machine learning in biology, which is a rapidly developing field that many students may be interested in. There are multiple possible directions students can take in the club as well, as they can choose which department they wish to join and work in.
