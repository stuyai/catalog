Mission:
Vote to read chapters from the "Proofs from THE BOOK" and discuss them

Meeting Schedule:
Our meeting schedule varies throughout the year, but we aim to meet around 2 times a month. However, not all meetings are mandatory. We do not have a specific day of the week we plan on meeting, so we will take a poll on it to see which day most members are free (days can change for every meeting).

Leaders:
Leonna Wang - Creator
Krish Bhandari - Vice President
