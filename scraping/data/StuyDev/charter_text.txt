How does this activity benefit Stuyvesant?:
Accessibility and communication are two of the most important parts of any community, and StuyDevâ€™s purpose is to create websites and applications that address both of these qualities. StuyDev takes extensive feedback from the Stuyvesant community, and creates the most wanted websites and apps, and in doing so provides a community for software engineers. StuyDev's mission revolves around innovation, collaboration, and learning, and these principles benefit the school community in a multitude of ways. First off, StuyDev provides a community where Stuy students can explore the exciting world of technology and design. In an era where digital literacy is extremely important, this club equips members with invaluable skills that extend far beyond the club. Moreover, StuyDev fosters a sense of belonging and camaraderie among its members. StuyDev provides a supportive and inclusive environment where students with varying levels of expertise come together to share ideas, learn from one another, and work on collaborative projects. This not only enhances its member's technical skills but also promotes teamwork and communication. In addition, StuyDev contributes to the school's digital presence by developing apps and websites that enhance communication and accessibility. Whether it's an app to streamline school event registrations or a website that provides valuable resources, StuyDev's creations make information more accessible and user-friendly for students, teachers, and parents alike. Ultimately, StuyDev enriches the Stuyvesant community by fostering innovation, providing essential skills, promoting collaboration, and enhancing digital accessibility. StuyDev's efforts not only benefit the current members but also contribute to the long-term success and growth of the Stuy community as a whole.

How does this activity appoint leaders?:
There are 2 leaders (co-presidents) in StuyDev, and new leaders are chosen by executive decision after the current leaders graduate, step down, or are impeached. StuyDev appoints members to leadership positions when there are seats available, and the following are considered when nominating members: commitment, programming experience, prior leadership experience, and contribution to the club. Nominees for leadership positions must be on the development team, should have participated in at least 90% of club meetings, and have contributed to the development of past websites. The number of project leaders depends on website demand. For every website under development, there are 2 project managers, one who deals with the software organization, and one who deals with logistics and website/app features. When a certain project is completed, the managers of that project need to begin a new project within a week to maintain their leadership position. There is also another leader who manages the website form and gathers website ideas from the Stuy community, and they must propose at least one idea a month. This idea manager undergoes the same appointment process as the co-presidents. The impeachment protocol for leaders is straightforward. If a leader isn't active without good reason, isn't contributing to the club, or fails to act as a leader, they will be considered for impeachment after extensive discussion with the other leader and project managers. If a leader is impeached, they cannot be reconsidered for leadership positions.

What makes this activity unique?:
StuyDev benefits the Stuyvesant High School student and teacher community while contributing to a strong community of designers and software engineers. StuyDev members build student and teacher-requested websites, and contributors to these websites build a strong college portfolio along the way. Members learn to work and communicate within a development team, giving students a setting similar to a real-world company setting. At StuyDev, the skills learned as a team are important throughout college and future careers.
