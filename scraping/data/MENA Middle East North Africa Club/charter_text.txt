Tuesday

What is the meeting schedule?:
There are still no set dates or given days for our meetings yet, but we will try to meet 2-4 times a month depending on upcoming events. More information will be released later.

What is the purpose of this activity?:
The MENA Organization is dedicated to representing the Middle Eastern and North African region for Stuyvesant students. Our club's mission is to foster a safe and inclusive space for the Arab population at Stuyvesant while extending a warm welcome to anyone intrigued by the culture and current affairs of the region. Our primary goal is to celebrate Arab culture through a vibrant array of activities, including culinary experiences, music appreciation, film screenings, and engaging events that bring the region's traditions to life.

Furthermore, the MENA Club is committed to making a positive impact by fundraising and advocating for underprivileged Arab communities in both New York and the broader Arab world. It's worth noting that our club's focus extends beyond volunteer work, although it remains a significant component. We also allocate time for enjoyable activities that allow us to immerse ourselves in the rich tapestry of the MENA region's heritage.

The meetings are scheduled 3-4 times a month, and while the club does not expect members to attend every meeting,  the more you invest, the more you'll gain.  Active participation is encouraged in brainstorming strategies to raise funds for ongoing crises and challenges in the MENA region. Additionally, it is requested that members attend  major events, as these gatherings are essential for building a sense of community and cultural appreciation.

The MENA club values its members' input and encourage them to suggest and even lead club activities. The MENA Organization aspires to be more than just an afterschool club; it aims to provide genuine support to those affected by natural disasters, human rights issues, and poverty in the MENA region. To achieve this, it will collaborate with other humanitarian organizations, offering students opportunities to network and establish connections with volunteer and governmental groups, ultimately making a lasting impact on the lives of those in need. Join us on this meaningful journey as we embrace the beauty of the MENA region and work together to make a positive difference in the world.

How does this activity benefit Stuyvesant?:
The Stuyvesant community currently lacks clubs dedicated to Arab, Middle Eastern, or North African identity. The MENA organization aims to fill this void and provide the representation that this group rightfully deserves. It recognizes the essential need for creating a safe and welcoming space for students who identify with this ethnicity, while also acknowledging the broader benefit it offers to non-Arab individuals. The organization promotes an inclusive environment where all members, regardless of their background, can find support and respect, as these are essential elements for the club's success.

The MENA organization's primary objective is to raise awareness within the Stuyvesant community about the challenges faced in the MENA region. Simultaneously, it offers students the opportunity to contribute to fundraising efforts aimed at alleviating those challenges. Engaging events will allow students to accrue volunteer hours while participating in activities that foster social interaction and the formation of new friendships.

In addition to its local impact, the MENA club seeks collaboration with other humanitarian organizations, opening doors for students to expand their networks and establish connections with volunteer and governmental groups for future endeavors. Leadership positions within the club will encourage students to step into prominent roles, including public speaking and assuming significant responsibilities.

Through the establishment of this club, the Stuyvesant community will cultivate greater cultural and social awareness, with a specific focus on minority groups such as the Arab population within the school.

How does this activity appoint leaders?:
The founders of the club will assume the roles of president and vice president. Additional leadership positions, such as treasurer and social media manager, will be filled through an interview process. The outgoing president and vice president will collaborate to select their successors. Newly elected presidents and vice presidents will have the authority to assemble their leadership teams.

In situations where a leader's effectiveness is compromised or removal is warranted, the president, in consultation with the vice president, holds the authority to take such action. If the president's conduct violates social conduct rules and necessitates removal, group leaders are encouraged to initiate a discussion with the club's faculty advisor regarding the removal process.

All leaders are expected to participate in club events and attend a minimum of two club meetings per month. Leaders who consistently fail to allocate the necessary time and effort to the club's activities may be transitioned to regular club membership status.

What makes this activity unique?:
No other clubs at Stuyvesant share the same focus and objectives as the MENA organization. Given the relatively small Arab population within the school, it becomes especially crucial to establish a dedicated space where these students can connect, fostering a sense of security and mutual understanding.

The MENA club's mission includes providing financial support to address ongoing crises in the Middle East, such as the earthquakes in Morocco, the floods in Libya, and the struggle for women's rights in Iran. What sets this club apart is its ability to simultaneously engage in humanitarian aid efforts while offering enjoyable activities and events like potlucks, movie nights, and outings. This dual approach enriches the club experience, ensuring a balance between serious, impactful work and the celebration of culture and community.
