Mission:
Our mission is to provide the opportunity for academic support to schools in underserved communities and promote better learning environments.

Meeting Schedule:
The Stuyvesant Study Society meeting schedule varies as we mainly communicate through email and each individual tutor makes their own meeting plans with their tutees. Normally tutors volunteer for one to two tutoring sessions a week. Tutoring sessions are held online through Zoom. If needed for logistical purposes, we may hold a couple in-person meetings over the course of the year.
