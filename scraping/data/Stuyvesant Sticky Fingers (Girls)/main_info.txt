Mission:
The Stuyvesant Sticky Fingers (Girls) bring Ultimate Frisbee to the Stuyvesant community, allowing players to compete in games in and out of the city.

Meeting Schedule:
Previously, the Stuyvesant Sticky Fingers have met 3 times a week (Mon, Thurs, and Sat) to practice throughout the year. During the Spring season, the team would meet up to play games against other teams in the city. Most out-of-state games would be on holiday weekends. This year, the captains will try to follow this schedule, but special attention to membersâ€™ availability will be kept in mind.

Leaders:
Janet Tong - Captain
Alexa Chiang - Captain
