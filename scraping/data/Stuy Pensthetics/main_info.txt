Mission:
Stuy Pensthetics aims to spread a love for modern calligraphy through the art of bullet journaling, penpalling, and other fun activities.

Meeting Schedule:
There will be weekly meetings (meeting days will depend on member availability). This club is low commitmentâ€”members can come whenever they can/ want to, but it is recommended that they come to a meeting once a week as this is when the pen pal exchange between club members will occur.
