Mission:
This club is dedicated to teaching the in's and out's of architecture through designing, creating model structures, and gaining experience from pros.

Meeting Schedule:
Every Monday we will have a mandatory meeting for members, but there will occasionally be Wednesday meetings in order to allot more time for our projects. Every Wednesday, however, there will be a drafting help session. These sessions are open to any students who would like help with the drafting class' coursework.
