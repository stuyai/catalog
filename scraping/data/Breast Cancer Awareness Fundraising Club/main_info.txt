Mission:
The mission of the Breast Cancer Awareness Fundraising Club is to collect enough funds to make a difference in the lives of those with breast cancer.

Meeting Schedule:
We plan to use polls to figure out which day of the week works best for all those who are interested, at least early on in the year. Wednesday and Thursday seem to be the most convenient days for now, but our schedule is flexible.

Leaders:
