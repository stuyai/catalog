Mission Statement:
StuyChemEng aims to spread interest in the chemical engineering field and its real-world applications through lessons, experiments, and guest speakers

What days does this organization meet?:
Tuesday

What is the meeting schedule?:
Every other Tuesdays (make up days on Wednesdays) from 3:45-4:45

What is the purpose of this activity?:
According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in chemical engineering is said to significantly increase by nine percent in the next decade. As supposed, chemical engineering is a demandable application in the real world, and Stuy Chemical Engineering (StuyChemEng) hopes to alleviate any stress that comes from that through simple teachings. StuyChemEng wants students to explore the many fields of work under chemical engineering that are both common and uncommon and that will help expand their knowledge in this field. StuyChemEng hopes to foster a community and unify those who seek a passion for STEM through heavy discussions about the benefits and obstacles of chemical engineering. Additionally, StuyChemEng hopes to help students recognize the importance and real world applications of their science courses with speakers and the discussions of chemical engineering. This club also welcomes those not as knowledgeable as others in the field and would like to provide as much guidance as possible through useful and insightful meetings to help build interest.

How does this activity benefit Stuyvesant?:
Although at first glance chemical engineering might seem to be a particular field of engineering that primarily revolves around chemistry, it is much more than that. Chemical engineering requires the knowledge of all three mandatory science courses at Stuy (biology, chemistry, physics), problem-solving skills, and mathematics. With this in mind, StuyChemEng hopes to further anyone’s passion in these subjects so that they can pursue a future with it as chemical engineering can be applicable to many possible career paths (ex. Pharmacy, nanotechnology, etc). However, not everyone who joins has to know exactly what they want to do as we also want to nurture or even develop interests in the sciences. To do this StuyChemEng will have lessons and activities based on the applications of this field so members can see how it compares with other fields of engineering or the sciences. The lessons will additionally touch on topics that will be taught in classes so it can serve as a way to understand the material conceptually or its real-world applications. StuyChemEng might also go into subjects that are beyond the curriculum at Stuyvesant so that members broaden interests in a specific part of, for example, the chemistry curriculum that isn’t taught in-depth.

How does this activity appoint leaders?:
This club consists of three main leadership roles: Presidents, Manager of Affairs, and Treasurer. The Co-President is in charge of leading the club through the development of lesson plans with presentations and hosting club activities. The Manager of Affairs handles social media platforms, proofreads lesson plans and social media posts, and reaches out to club members via email and social media as a reminder for upcoming meetings. The Manager of Affairs also reaches out to potential guest speakers that have a strong experience in the field and is required to consistently promote the club to students. Members are welcome to reach out to the Manager of Affairs for any feedback and assistance they may need. The treasurer is responsible for determining how to set budgets and use supplies efficiently during experiments and activities. The president-in-training is responsible for overlooking the club alongside the president and learning to maintain the club in future years through similar roles as those of the president.Future leadership will be determined through Google Forms which will question applicants on their interest and ability to partake in leadership, which will later be checked over by the Co-President(s). No prior leadership experience is required but is prioritized to those who have shown dedication and commitment to the club. All leaders must show their dedication and communicate efficiently with the rest of the board and members. If any leader fails to show dedication to their role or is constantly absent during meetings, their leadership is at risk of being revoked. In this case, all club members would vote on its removal. Club members must attend all meetings, where attendance is taken, unless excused by a board member.

What makes this activity unique?:
The field of engineering is difficult and overwhelming to navigate due to all the areas within it. However, StuyChemEng aims to focus on a specific field within engineering commonly known as chemical engineering. To achieve this, StuyChemEng will provide lessons and activities based on an application or aspect of chemical engineering. These lessons will incorporate what students have learned in their science classes. From these lessons and activities, StuyChemEng aims to develop a general understanding, or even passion, towards the subject that was focused on.
