Mission:
Spreading joy and happiness to individuals undergoing medical treatments by organizing events and workshops that bring smiles to their faces.

Meeting Schedule:
Our meeting schedule will differ throughout the year depending on the semester, but we will typically meet a few times a month to review our upcoming events and recent accomplishments. Events/activities dates will vary, but we will aim to have at least an event every month, with the exception of midterms weeks, finals weeks, and Advanced Placement (AP) weeks.
