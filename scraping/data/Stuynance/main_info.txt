Mission:
Stuynanceâ€™s mission is to make financial knowledge easily accessible to anyone.

Meeting Schedule:
Since many people at Stuyvesant are in multiple clubs or have other responsibilities after school, club members can vote at the beginning of the year to decide which days work best for everyone. These times can then be adjusted throughout the year, but occur at least once a month and often more.

Leaders:
Ethan Khosh - President
