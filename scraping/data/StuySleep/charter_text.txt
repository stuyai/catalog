What is the purpose of this activity?:
In a world where sleep is often overlooked, this club aims to teach the fundamentals of healthy sleep habits, stress management, and relaxation techniques.

With the mission to improve well-being and enhance academic performance, our club offers a sanctuary for those seeking a better, rejuvenating slumber. 

In this club, members will learn about different techniques relating to optimizing their ability to get rest. From educating members on sleep cycles, to providing members a safe place to get rest, this club seeks to address the problem that plagues a majority of Stuyvesant students: chronic sleep deprivation. StuySleep aims to do more than merely educate it's members on the topic of sleep; we intend to put out knowledge into practice, studying how our sleep impacts our daily lives, implementing systems to remedy lack of sleep, and creating a supportive community that encourages healthy habits.

Learning effective sleep hygiene practices and relaxation methods can significantly improve student's sleep quality. In turn, this can lead to increased energy levels, heightened focus, and improved academic performance. Joining StuySleep offers an array of comprehensive benefits to its members that extend well beyond the surface. Firstly, the club delves deep into the intricate science behind sleep, fostering a profound understanding of how sleep impacts overall well-being. Members become well-versed in a wide spectrum of knowledge, including the subtleties of sleep hygiene practices, the art of stress management, and an array of relaxation techniques, all of which are integral to optimizing the quality of one's sleep. Consequently, students who actively engage with the club often experience not just incremental, but transformative shifts in their lives, marked by heightened energy levels, unwavering concentration, and a notable spike in their academic performance. In addition to the tangible advantages, the club also offers a unique, nurturing community for its members. This supportive network allows individuals to candidly share their own personal sleep-related challenges and triumphant journeys, fostering a sense of belonging and empathy among peers. It's within this safe space that lasting friendships and meaningful connections are cultivated, making the club not just a source of knowledge but a haven of understanding and camaraderie.

This results in an elevated quality of life, defined by enhanced well-being, academic success, and the priceless sense of belonging that comes from being part of a caring and supportive community.

How does this activity appoint leaders?:
Leadership positions are appointed through present effort to uphold the mission statement of the club. They will be appointed regularly, and will be reevaluated on a per semester basis. Leadership members are expected to educate other members and conduct meetings on their own, filling in slots for meetings when available or applicable. Members are expected to act with respect to others, maintaining a level of cleanliness and maturity, but are free to attend meetings as they please, meaning that there is no requirement for members to regularly attend meetings. Between school years, leadership will be transferred to the highest leadership position of the subsequent year, provided that the general consensus among leaders of the leaving year agree. If leaders act in an improper way, they will be removed from the club itself, as long as other leadership positions agree. The leadership positions will be flexible, and are prone to change in number as members join and leave.

What makes this activity unique?:
Our organization is unique in the sense that we understand the Stuyvesant community very strongly. We're down to earth, and seek to encourage productivity in fun ways. Through education, we believe that we can solve one of Stuyvesant's biggest problems compassionately. Our laid-back nature allows members, as well as non-members, to improve their quality of life through learning about sleep. In recognizing this issue, and being upfront with it and its impacts, our organization will provide much needed services that aren't offered anywhere else at school.
