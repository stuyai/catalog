Mission:
Stuyvesant Improv is a safe, non-competitive space for students to express themselves and unlock their creativity, all while laughing and having fun.

Meeting Schedule:
We meet once a week for 8 mostly-consecutive weeks in Autumn, and then again in the Spring. The day of the week on which we meet will be the same every week, but what day that is will be set in stone at the first meeting.

Leaders:
Maxwell Schoenstein
Bowden Chen
