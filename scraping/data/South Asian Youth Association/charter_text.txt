Mission Statement:
The South Asian Youth Association aims to create a community that empowers and unites South Asian youth.

What days does this organization meet?:
Friday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday

What is the meeting schedule?:
We are planning on meeting once or twice a month, but this may increase depending on turnout. We will try to hold meetings on days when the majority of members are available.

What is the purpose of this activity?:
The South Asian Youth Association (SAYA) is a dynamic and inclusive organization dedicated to creating a community for South Asian youth. Our mission is to foster a sense of belonging, personal growth, and cultural appreciation among our members. This club is a place where South Asian students will be able to find others who share the same interests as them, as well as an opportunity for others to learn about South Asian culture. During meetings, members will gain insight into the South Asian world through presentations and stories on holidays, history, traditions, and more. There will be activities such as Kahoots, Jeopardy, and movie nights to help students unwind. We also plan on holding several events throughout the year, such as Diwali and Holi celebrations, which members will help organize and carry out. Each member will be expected to treat each other with respect and kindness, regardless of culture, religion, or identity.

How does this activity benefit Stuyvesant?:
SAYA provides an opportunity for all students, not just those of South Asian heritage, to gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of South Asian culture. By learning about the traditions, history, and festivities of South Asia, students can broaden their horizons and develop a more inclusive worldview. In addition, South Asia is a broad region that encompasses several countries, including India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and more. SAYA allows South Asian students to share experiences from their own countries while learning more about other South Asian countries. This club promotes diversity and fosters an environment where all cultures are celebrated and respected and is committed to inclusivity and unity. By promoting respect and kindness among members regardless of their cultural, religious, or personal backgrounds, SAYA sets a positive example for the entire school community. This commitment to inclusivity extends beyond the club, helping to create a school culture where diversity is not just acknowledged but celebrated. Furthermore, our club organizes various social activities, including movie nights and cultural celebrations like Diwali and Holi events. These events provide opportunities for students to socialize, relax, and build friendships outside the classroom. This social engagement contributes to a positive school atmosphere and strengthens the sense of belonging among students. Overall, SAYA benefits Stuyvesant by promoting inclusivity and knowledge about the South Asian community.

How does this activity appoint leaders?:
Currently, the cabinet will consist of the President, Vice President(s), and Managers. We plan on having an Events Manager, an Outreach Manager, and a Social Media Manager. Applications for manager roles will be released at the beginning of the school year. The Events Manager will be responsible for working with the Presidents to plan and organize our bigger events such as holiday celebrations. The Outreach Manager will be in charge of communicating with faculty and any outside sources to make these events a reality. The Social Media Manager, as the name suggests, will run our social media account, which will most likely be Instagram. The cabinet will also plan and lead meetings. We will have a 3-strike system for managers, after which they will be removed if necessary. Once the current president and vice president graduate, leadership will be handed down to members of the cabinet in lower grades through a vote.

What makes this activity unique?:
This is the only club at Stuyvesant that focuses on South Asia as a whole instead of a single country, which allows South Asian students to learn new stories and experiences. We will examine and bond over the similarities and differences in our culture, language, and traditions. This club uniquely unites South Asian students and introduces them to an organization where they can meet new friends with similar interests. We will also take charge in creating events and celebrations for South Asian students, and we believe we can do so as a united club.
