Mission:
Future Financiersâ€™ mission is to educate students about financial literacy and help group students together to participate in official competitions.

Meeting Schedule:
Future4Financiers meets biweekly over virtual meetings with the purpose of hosting lessons to teach finance to students across the country. Members who do not feel comfortable leading a lesson/being an educator can watch and participate in meetings until they feel comfortable. Other meetings may be scheduled in-person at community centers, schools, and libraries with the same goal of educating the New York City community; these meetings are highly recommended although not required.
