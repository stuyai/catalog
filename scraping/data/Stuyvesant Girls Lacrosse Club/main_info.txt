Mission:
This club aims to both improve beginner and experienced members' lacrosse skills prior to the spring lacrosse season.

Meeting Schedule:
Our meetings will most likely be 2-3 times a week in the fall and early winter depending on the weather. We understand that members may not be able to attend all the practices so members are highly encouraged to end at least 3 meetings a month.
