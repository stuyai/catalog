Mission Statement:
StuyIndianClassics will teach students the behind-the-scenes processes of producing Indian classical music

What days does this organization meet?:
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday

What is the meeting schedule?:
Our meeting schedule will vary, as it is difficult to involve instruments and other things within a club. StuyIndianClassics will meet at least twice a month, 1 day a week throughout the entire year.

What is the purpose of this activity?:
During meetings, club leaders will teach members the Indian classical arts. StuyIndianClassics harbors an environment for those wishing to express their talents in the Indian classics and those who want to learn. Each meeting will consist of learning different arts while also practicing to perform these arts as well. StuyIndianClassics strives to teach people about arts outside of the Western world and introduce them to a different style of arts within Asia. Members who are proficient in Indian classics can also use our space as grounds to practice with others. We hope that in the future, we will be able to hold performances and express the talents and beauty of Indian classical arts and work with other clubs to do the same. StuyIndianClassics members must participate in activities presented within meetings by learning, educating, practicing, or volunteering. Leaders are expected to lead the club, attend whenever they can, and follow and adhere to club customs, rules, and purpose.

How does this activity benefit Stuyvesant?:
StuyIndianClassics is a community of individuals who are passionate about Indian culture and are willing to showcase their talent and experience to the rest of the world. This club serves as a bridge between those who are invested in Indian culture and those who are curious to learn more about it. Members of StuyIndianClassics are offered an opportunity to indulge in a new taste of culture, music, art, and dance. By doing so, they not only broaden their knowledge of Indian culture but also gain valuable insights into different forms of art and expression. StuyIndianClassics also provides the school with a cultural outlook and diversity, while also encouraging students with hidden talents to express themselves. The Stuyvesant community is presented with a chance to witness art from various parts of the Indian classical world and explore new horizons in the field of the Indian classical arts. Students and teachers alike can gaze upon the beauty of traditional artistic forms that they might not have encountered otherwise. Through cultural performances, exhibitions, and interactive workshops. The Stuyvesant community will ultimately have a dynamic force that promotes understanding, diversity, and artistic expression leaving a lasting and meaningful impact within the Stuyvesant community and beyond

How does this activity appoint leaders?:
Leadership positions are handed down through initiatives and showing actual engagement with StuyIndianClassics. Leaders of this club must understand and treat their role within the club as part of their priorities within the school, as well as maintaining punctuality within the club's rules, such as maintaining involvement and playing an active role in meetings. Those who wish to be part of the Board must contact one of the existing leaders or the president of the club whether in-person or online etc. What matters is what significance those who want to be appointed bring to the table. Leadership positions may contain the usual roles ex. president, vice-president etc. However in StuyIndianClassics leadership positions can be gained through talent, skill or proficiency in Indian classical Arts. For those who have proven their skill, we ask them to become mentors to future members who want to learn the Indian classical arts. Leaders are Impeached and stripped of their role, when they have committed an offense, shown no involvement or proactiveness within meetings or in the club in general. While members are not expected to show up to every meeting, we do encourage them to come at least one time per marking period.

What makes this activity unique?:
StuyIndianClassics presents itself as a club of professionalism in the realm of arts across the world. In that sense, we wish to raise members to higher and higher calibres within Indian classical arts. StuyIndianClassics while not being the only club that involves members within the realm of Indian Culture, is one if not the only club that expresses to its members that they will experience Indian Classical Arts at the professional level. StuyIndianClassics remains different in the fact that meetings involve production and education at the same time. No other club does this, to the extent StuyIndianClassics does and will.
