Mission:
StuyLaw provides an enriching experience for all to delve into the legal world and builds bridges between students and legal professionals.

Meeting Schedule:
StuyLaw hosts general meetings, with activities ranging from legal discussions to legal presentations to other legal activities, two times a month. A StuyLaw executive surveys members on the meeting date the week before a designated meeting, in which the most popular day is chosen. StuyLaw will have one legal guest speaker per month and additionally provide multiple virtual live court days for the membersâ€™ discretion. Virtual court schedules will be posted at the beginning of each month when available. These activities and their frequencies are subject to change.
