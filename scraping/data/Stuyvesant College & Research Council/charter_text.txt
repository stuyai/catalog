What is the purpose of this activity?:
Stuyvesant College & Research Council, originally the research section of Stuyvesant Biology, is a dedicated organization aimed at assisting enthusiastic and science-driven Stuyvesant students across all disciplines, including biology, chemistry, physics, and more. Our primary objective is to help these students establish a solid foundation for their college applications and thrive in their college life. Comprising three essential aspects, our council offers a comprehensive approach to support our members. The research aspect serves as a gateway to exciting science internships and research opportunities, where students can immerse themselves in real-world scientific endeavors, showcase their knowledge, and garner recognition from seasoned professionals. By participating in these experiences, students gain invaluable insights and practical skills that pave the way for successful careers in the scientific realm. In the college-preparation aspect, we equip students with essential tools and knowledge to navigate the college application process seamlessly. From mastering the art of college essay writing to honing the art of cold emailing for internships, our comprehensive guidance ensures that students present their best selves to potential institutions. Our mentorship aspect further enhances the support system within our council. Pairing underclassmen with experienced upperclassmen creates a nurturing environment where students can seek advice, guidance, and answers to their queries about research, college life, and life in general. This peer-to-peer interaction fosters camaraderie and helps students grow both academically and personally. We provide a platform where students from all backgrounds can come together to share their passion for science and collaborate on innovative projects. Throughout the year, we organize various events, seminars, and workshops that further enrich our members' scientific knowledge and cultivate a strong sense of community. The Stuyvesant College & Research Council plays a crucial role in empowering aspiring scientists at Stuyvesant, helping them embark on a journey of academic excellence, personal growth, and meaningful contributions to the scientific world. The research aspect introduces and engages students in various exciting science internships and opportunities to showcase their knowledge and gain recognition from professional scientists. The college-preparation aspect gears students and familiarizes them with the college application process, college essay writing, and cold emailing for internships. The mentorship aspect pairs students, particularly underclassmen, with upperclassmen in the club and provides a mode of contact for members in the club to ask questions about research, college, or life in general.

How does this activity benefit Stuyvesant?:
In high schools across the nation, students often find themselves missing out on exciting opportunities to nurture their passions and interests, whether it be in scientific research, competitions, journalism, or other fields. Unfortunately, as they approach the end of their high school journey, many students are left with regrets about not having taken advantage of these chances to showcase their skill sets. Recognizing this unmet need, the Stuyvesant College and Research Council has made it their mission and top priority to guide enthusiastic and driven students towards internships, programs, competitions, and other meaningful activities that allow them to explore and experience their passions beyond the confines of the classroom. To achieve this goal, the council will hold weekly or biweekly meetings where board members will conduct engaging and informative presentations using platforms like Google Slides or Canva. Each presentation will focus on a specific skill set, alternating between science-related topics and college access advice. For example, one week may be dedicated to finding and navigating internships, another to exploring specific areas of research such as organic chemistry, molecular biology, psychology, neuroscience, and so forth, while another may focus on mastering the art of cold emailing for securing opportunities. As part of the council's comprehensive support system, members will gain access to a dedicated Google Drive containing a wealth of information detailing various accessible programs, summer opportunities, events, and more. Additionally, each member will be paired with a personal mentor who will conduct weekly check-ins outside of the regular meetings. This mentorship will provide personalized guidance and support, addressing individual questions and concerns, and encouraging students to grow both academically and personally. Creating an academically stimulating yet unwinding environment, the Stuyvesant College and Research Council will foster a community of like-minded individuals who share a passion for knowledge and exploration. By actively seeking out and participating in these extracurricular endeavors, students will not only gain valuable experiences but also build a strong foundation for their future college applications and personal growth. The Stuyvesant College and Research Council is committed to empowering high school students by helping them unlock the potential of their interests and talents outside of traditional classroom settings. By offering guidance, mentorship, and a supportive community, the council strives to ensure that no student regrets missing out on exciting opportunities that could shape their academic and professional trajectory.

How does this activity appoint leaders?:
Throughout the year, the Co-Presidents will take attendance at every club meeting and take note of contributions from the members on a Google Spreadsheet. At the end of May every year, the Co-Presidents will release a Google Form of short questions that an applicant interested in applying for leadership positions will fill out and send to the official Stuyvesant College & Research Council email, after which the Co-Presidents and current Chief Executives will review. For all Chief Executive positions, applicants must showcase dedication to the club, having gone to a majority of the meetings and been both engaged and determined throughout). This will be the first round, and during the second round, the Co-Presidents, with the approval from their Chief Executives of the applicant, will interview the applicant to gauge how the applicant would be a significant contributor to the area of the club they are applying to be a leader in. Stuyvesant College & Research Council has three main branches: research, college preparation, and mentorship, as stated in the charter. As a result, each branch will have a Chief Executive. For the position of Chief Executive of Research, the applicant will submit a presentation of their scientific (or non-scientific) passion, which the applicant will showcase during the interview. For the position of Chief Executive of College Preparation, the applicant will need to answer specific questions about the college admissions process that have been discussed during previous meetings and answer most, if not all, the questions correctly during the interview. For the position of Chief Executive of Mentorship, the applicant will be given a scenario involving a problem with a mentee and how they would go about resolving the issue during the interview. These side requirements - presentation, question-answering, and acting on scenarios - would be in addition to the short Google Form, but the entire process will be as holistic and simplistic as possible.

What makes this activity unique?:
Stuyvesant College & Research Council offers a not only close-knit community among its members, but also a direct relationship between upperclassmen mentors and underclassmen mentees to prepare all students for future scientific internships and programs, competitions, the college admissions process, and life beyond high school in general. The Co-Presidents and Chief Executives will strive to learn more about their members, the passions of their members, and the goals of their members, after which the board members will create personalized Google Drives with a collection of links to various opportunities that the board thinks would best suit each member based on their passions. In addition, board members will host virtual “check-ins” every Friday over Zoom, in which members will be able to ask questions about anything in a relaxing environment. Even during the summer, members will work on creative presentations, which they will present once a week for the summer.
