Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday

What is the meeting schedule?:
We will aim to meet 1-2 times a month, but schedules will vary throughout the year depending on what days of the week the leaders are free.

What is the purpose of this activity?:
The purpose of the COD Mobile club is to foster an environment of support, friendship, community, and happiness through playing COD Mobile. The game centers around the core concepts of leadership, teamwork, and communication. Through this club, we hope to build leaders and team players of the future. The game requires constant communication with teammates, which will only grow communication skills. Many students at Stuyvesant play this game on their own. Although it can be fun alone, only together can we become the best versions of ourselves in COD Mobile. COD is something that people of all backgrounds can enjoy. Whether you are an experienced veteran or total beginner, this club is for you! We will teach you everything you need to know about COD! Anyone can download this game for free on their phone, so there’s no restriction on who can join. Feel free to reach out to any of us with any questions!

How does this activity benefit Stuyvesant?:
A Call of Duty Mobile club offers a plethora of benefits that cater to both casual gamers and competitive enthusiasts alike. First and foremost, such a club serves as a dynamic platform for like-minded individuals to connect, fostering a sense of community and camaraderie among players who share a passion for the game. This social aspect extends beyond virtual interactions, often leading to real-life friendships and connections. Additionally, a COD Mobile club provides a structured environment for players to improve their skills through friendly matches, strategy discussions, and collaborative learning. Whether a beginner seeking guidance or a seasoned player aiming to enhance their tactics, the club offers a platform for skill development and growth.

The competitive dimension of a COD Mobile club cannot be overlooked. Players have the opportunity to participate in organized tournaments, sharpening their teamwork, communication, and decision-making abilities. The club's events and competitions not only provide a thrilling gaming experience but also offer the chance to win prizes and recognition. Furthermore, being part of a COD Mobile club can lead to the discovery of professional gaming pathways, with some players advancing to higher levels of competitive play. The club environment can serve as a stepping stone to join established esports teams, opening doors to potential sponsorships and a career in the gaming industry.

On a personal level, the club encourages a healthy balance between gaming and other aspects of life. Members can share tips on managing screen time, avoiding burnout, and maintaining overall well-being. By promoting responsible gaming habits, the club helps individuals derive maximum enjoyment from their gaming experience while maintaining a healthy lifestyle. In summary, a COD Mobile club offers a multifaceted array of advantages encompassing social interaction, skill development, competitive engagement, and personal growth. It is not merely a group united by a shared interest but a platform that enriches the lives of gamers through friendship, improvement, and achievement.

How does this activity appoint leaders?:
For this upcoming school year, the co-presidents will be the founders Grace Na, Geoffrey Huang, Duncan Park, and Evan Wong. Other positions such as marketing and finance directors will be established through application consisting of a google form and an interview. In future years, senior leadership will be elected by outgoing presidents. They will vote democratically and discuss justly to determine the future presidents. The vice presidents and president will make up an executive board, all of which will hold equal votes in any and all decisions. If there is a tie, the president has the deciding vote. In the case of impeachment of presidents and vice presidents, members of the club can bring up issues to other members of the board and ask for removal. Anyone who brings up an issue with a president needs to have an acceptable reason, that of which will be determined by the presidents not in question. The executive board will vote on the fate of the president in question. It should be noted that the president in question will have a chance to defend themself but cannot vote.

What makes this activity unique?:
There isn’t a club that offers COD Mobile at Stuyvesant. Though there are already numerous clubs for mobile gaming, COD Mobile doesn’t have a club at Stuy. This club will provide a space for all COD Mobile fans to play and bond. Many clubs at Stuyvesant are for things that are “good” for college, or that are more on the academia side. While those are all good causes and things that people should pursue, there should also be more opportunity for students to destress from the tiring Stuyvesant life.
