Mission:
We plan to bring forth research behind why students feel stressed because of school and provide them with resources and coping mechanisms to students

Meeting Schedule:
We’ll be holding meetings every other week to serve as a recollection of what the survey polls have shown. We’ll also be holding meetings through zoom relatively often to checkpoint how far we’ve come with our research.
