Mission:
The goal of this club is to prep students (primarily sophomores) for the AP Chemistry Course and AP Exam in May.

Meeting Schedule:
Our meeting schedule varies throughout the year, but will probably be once ever week for questions/ preparations for unit content for AP chemistry. Also, on the Monday or Friday before an AP Chemistry exam will we hold a review questions to answer questions and cover general content that is important to know for the specific test.
Also, during May, might meet (online/ in-person) twice a week to do test prep for the AP Chemistry exam.
