Mission:
The Stuyvesant Music Outreach League aims to use our musical abilities and talents to bring joy to those around us.

Meeting Schedule:
Our meeting schedule varies throughout the year, but we plan to meet a few times a month to check up on each other, and as we get closer to a performance, we would meet more often in order to review and run through what we have planned. We have stated that our meetings will be held on Thursdays, but this can be adjusted to meet the needs and preferences of the members.

Leaders:
Josephine Yoo - Founder and Co-President
Wilson Li - Executive
Philip Zhang - Outreach Director
Ethan Sie - Vice President
Geoffrey Huang - Secretary
Ethan Pak - Media Manager
