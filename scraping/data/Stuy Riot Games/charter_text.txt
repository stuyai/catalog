Mission Statement:
The Stuy Riot Games Club gathers individuals who enjoy and love various games developed by Riot Games into a community 
for all gaming enthusiasts.

What days does this organization meet?:
Friday, Tuesday

What is the meeting schedule?:
Our meeting will depend on the availability of the players, but we hope to meet on Tuesdays and every week of the month, with breaks when there is a new set.

What is the purpose of this activity?:
The Stuy Riot Games Club is a thriving community that brings together students who share a deep passion for various games developed by Riot Games. Our primary purpose is to create a dynamic and inclusive environment where gaming enthusiasts can connect, collaborate, and immerse themselves in the captivating worlds of titles such as League of Legends, TeamFight Tactics, Valorant, and more.

Through our club activities, we aim to promote teamwork, strategic thinking, and skill development among our members. Game nights serve as a platform for students to engage in exhilarating gameplay sessions, forge friendships, and strengthen their collaborative abilities. Additionally, the club hosts a diverse array of tournaments and events that provide exciting opportunities for friendly competition and a chance to showcase individual gaming prowess.

Moreover, the Stuy Riot Games Club endeavors to foster a sense of belonging and support, regardless of a member's gaming experience or skill level. We organize engaging discussions and workshops to deepen members' understanding of game mechanics, tactics, and the latest updates from Riot Games. By collaborating with other gaming clubs and participating in community outreach initiatives, we aim to contribute positively to the school community.

Ultimately, our club aspires to serve as a haven where students can find solace from the pressures of academic life, experience the joy of gaming, and build lasting friendships that extend beyond the virtual realm.

How does this activity benefit Stuyvesant?:
The Riot Games Club at Stuyvesant will benefit the school community in various ways, fostering a supportive and enjoyable environment centered around gaming experiences offered by Riot Games. By introducing students to a diverse range of games developed by Riot Games, the club provides an opportunity for them to explore and learn how to play different titles, catering to a variety of interests.

The club serves as a platform to connect existing players who share a passion for Riot Games' creations, facilitating the formation of lasting friendships within the gaming community. Regardless of their familiarity with Riot Games, all members will find a welcoming and relaxed atmosphere that encourages social interactions and strengthens bonds among fellow players.

Coaching sessions and tournaments will be integral to the club's activities, providing opportunities for like-minded individuals to come together and engage in friendly competitions or receive guidance to improve their gaming skills. This fosters a sense of camaraderie and connection among members as they collectively explore the diverse and immersive worlds of Riot Games.

As Riot Games' titles cover a broad spectrum of genres and themes, the club will fuel creativity and imaginative thinking, allowing students to experience captivating storytelling and diverse gameplay mechanics. Such experiences may inspire students in their creative endeavors, whether it be through art, storytelling, or game design.

Additionally, gaming can serve as a healthy outlet for stress relief and relaxation, benefiting students' overall well-being and providing a refreshing break from the demands of academic life. By fostering a supportive and fun community, the Riot Games Club aims to create a haven where students can unwind, bond, and share their love for gaming.

How does this activity appoint leaders?:
We will have two co-presidents, a treasurer, a head coach, and social media manager. Some protocols that members are expected to follow include understanding the purpose of the club and maintaining its positive and relaxed atmosphere, having fun. Members with leadership positions are expected to be present in most meetings unless there are more urgent commitments such as schoolwork or family. Our leadership positions will be determined through a vote by the club's passionate members. If a leader fails to meet the standard of the members, then a vote can be held to impeach the leader with a 65% majority needed. We will offer training positions where newer members can learn about the different roles and see if they are fit for the job. The trial period will last for 2 months and at the end of the school year, a new council of leaders is elected to replace graduating members.

What makes this activity unique?:
The Riot Games Club at Stuyvesant is a unique and inclusive community that celebrates the diverse array of games developed by Riot Games, not limited to a specific title like TFT. Unlike other gaming clubs that focus on mainstream competitive genres, our club embraces the auto chess genre and welcomes players interested in various Riot Games creations.

As the only club at Stuyvesant dedicated to the auto chess genre, we aim to fill the gap and provide a space for students to explore this engaging and strategic gaming experience. Our long-term tournament sets us apart from other clubs, ensuring that there will always be exciting and competitive activities for our members.

The Stuyvesant Riot community is vibrant but dispersed, and our club serves as an opportunity to unite players, fostering lasting connections and friendships. While Riot Games' titles can be enjoyed individually, the true essence of fun lies in playing together, and we strive to create an environment where students can enjoy shared gaming experiences.

Inclusivity is at the heart of our club's values. There are no rank requirements or prerequisites for joining or participating in our activities. Whether you are a seasoned player or new to Riot Games, we are excited to have you in our club and ensure you have a fantastic time with us. The Riot Games Club at Stuyvesant is a welcoming haven for all gaming enthusiasts, embracing a diverse and passionate community of players.
