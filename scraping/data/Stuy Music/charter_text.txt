Mission Statement:
The club will serve as a low stress environment for Stuy’s musicians to practice and receive advice from other players.

What days does this organization meet?:
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday

What is the meeting schedule?:
The schedule may be somewhat variable, but generally we will attempt to meet at least once a week. These meetings may take place on any day, but it will not be required that members attend any meeting they don't wish to or are not able to attend

What is the purpose of this activity?:
The club seeks to provide a place and time for all of Stuyvesant's students who play an instrument to hone their skills through practice. In furtherance of this goal, the club will seek to foster a large community of musicians, which will give everyone involved a chance to learn and teach, as well as a chance to practice pieces with other people. The club will strive to be stress and expectation free, and as such will not work towards any large performance, which adds stress to busy schedules, limits the people who can join, and makes practicing more intimidating. Instead, the club will try to provide a handful of pieces which people can voluntarily chose to play or practice alone or in a group, with no audience. Alternatively, members may practice pieces which they provide themselves, or use the club as a forum to request suggestions for music and exercises which would be beneficial for them to practice. Worth noting is that the club will readily accept anyone who’s interested, from the most expert players to those picking up an instrument for the first time.

How does this activity benefit Stuyvesant?:
The club offers a variety of benefits for everyone involved in Stuy’s music programs. For all players, it would provide a place to practice and have fun with music, and it could provide a number of other benefits to players of all levels. For beginner musicians, this would be the only place in Stuy which provides a chance to have the basics of their instruments explained to them, and which could answer questions about technique, music theory, reading music, and any other question they might have related to their instrument. This personalized guidance not only accelerates their learning curve but also fosters a sense of accomplishment and confidence in their musical journey. For intermediate players, the club would provide a chance to seek out advice on pieces they need to practice, suggestions on what and how they should improve, and exercises they should practice to strengthen their playing. This tailored guidance ensures they continue progressing and refining their skills. For experienced players, the club would provide a chance to share advice with less experienced players and to discuss what changes they should make in their playing to improve further. This exchange of knowledge and experiences fosters a culture of mentorship and mutual growth, enhancing the overall musical atmosphere at Stuyvesant.

How does this activity appoint leaders?:
Because of the casual nature of the club, it shouldn’t require significant leadership, and so the captains(called directors)will have a fairly limited role. The club will have a board of three directors who will be responsible for planning meetings, and who will have the authority to remove people from the club with a unanimous vote. At the end of the year each director can select their successor, which may be themselves if they will continue to be at the school the following year. In the case that one of the directors is to be replaced, the other two directors must:
Both agree that the other director should be removed, and
They should agree on a replacement director
If a director wishes to leave before the school year ends, they may select a replacement themselves, or cede that responsibility to the other directors. The members of the club may, at any time, replace a director if they have a supermajority(2/3) which supports a specific individual to replace them.

What makes this activity unique?:
While Stuyvesant offers a great deal of opportunities to perform music, and clubs expand the offerings, every other club or class fails to provide one or both of the following:
1. A stress-and-expectation-free space for people to practice instruments: Most musical opportunities at Stuy are based around working towards a performance, and while this is rewarding, it doesn’t offer a chance for people to practice at their own pace, and can be too stressful, intimidating, or high commitment for people to participate in it.
2. An environment focused on learning and teaching: Other clubs and classes for playing music generally fail to offer a place for less experienced players to ask questions or receive feedback about what they can change directly from someone who is very familiar with their instrument. Furthermore these clubs and classes generally don’t offer a chance for more experienced players to share what they have learned, which both helps others and helps experienced players to improve their understanding of their own playing
