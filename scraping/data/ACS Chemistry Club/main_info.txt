Mission:
ACS Chemistry club's mission is to help students further their understanding of AP Chemistry, chemistry in general, as well as assistance with labs.

Meeting Schedule:
Our club plans to meet every Friday. However, these weekly meetings are not definite and are subject to change depending on the availability of the members. To ensure that the greatest number of members can make it to the meetings, we will conduct a poll in our Facebook group to see which day of the week is more convenient for members. In addition, we will always post a reminder on upcoming events in our Facebook group to remind our members. We will usually meet 2-4 times per month.
