Mission:
Nutriderms aims to create a fun and safe space for learning about nutrition and its impact on the skin.

Meeting Schedule:
Our meeting schedule may vary throughout the year, but we plan to hold an in person meeting at least once a month to foster closer relationships between the members. We will also hold virtual meetings on Zoom every Monday or Tuesday depending on member availability so that we could discuss ideas for the infographics/videos/articles and future fundraisers.
