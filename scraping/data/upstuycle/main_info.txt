Mission:
Upstuycle is for lovers of fashion and crafting who want to exercise their creativity in a sustainable way.

Meeting Schedule:
Upstuycle's meetings will occur between three and four times a month, and the meeting day will be set once availability has been gauged. For now, it is tentatively set to Thursday. Since new activities are introduced every meeting, attendance is always optional, but the more meetings attended, the more projects created.
