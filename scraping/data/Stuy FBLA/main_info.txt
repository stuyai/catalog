Mission:
Stuy FBLA's goal is to foster a community of future business leaders through conferences, student-led workshops, online resources, and more.

Meeting Schedule:
Meetings are held on Thursdays and occasionally Fridays. At the beginning of each month, a meeting will be held which goes over the events of the month and offers reminders on upcoming deadlines. There will also be 1-2 workshops in which students can hone their skills in a specific area under the guidance of an experienced student mentor. More meetings may be held each month for a special occasion. Members can also choose to attend the district conference, which will be released early in the season. More opportunities include the state and national conferences, but those events have prerequisites for qualification.
