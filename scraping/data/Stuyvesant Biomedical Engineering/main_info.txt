Mission:
Stuyvesant Biomedical Engineering (BME) fosters an environment for students to explore specialty areas within and gain hands-on application of BME.

Meeting Schedule:
Our meeting schedule varies throughout the year, but we meet at least once a month. When we are working on a large project, meetings will be more frequent, ranging from 1-2 times a week. Most lessons will be held online, most guest speaker events will be held in-person, and large projects must be done in-person.
