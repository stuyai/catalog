Mission:
STUA aims to study, discuss, and educate others about public transit and urban planning.

Meeting Schedule:
The club will function on a per-week basis in regard to meetings. Meeting dates will be posted to the club's social media and to StuyActivities, along with other events (e.g. fundraisers, trips, etc.). Meeting dates will be determined in advance by the Co-Presidents when necessary, but meetings will generally take place from 3:45 - 5:00.
Meetings at the school, when they are held, will be geared towards urbanism, and students will get the opportunity to discuss the future of cities with other students passionate about the subject. Meetings as a whole will be geared towards transit. 
We wish to use club feedback to improve meeting attendance by reworking meeting dates and adding urbanism-based concepts as meeting topics. We will submit an idea for a club meeting on the club's media platforms and poll members on their availability. When this is assessed, the meeting will be scheduled on the said day.
