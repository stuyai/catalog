Mission Statement:
Stuy SSI is the Stuyvesant Chapter of the Super Student Initiative, a nonprofit dedicated towards providing elementary schools tutoring and toys.

What days does this organization meet?:
Wednesday

What is the meeting schedule?:
Meeting schedule can vary throughout the year, but we meet at least twice a month as a club and more often as designated student groups.

What is the purpose of this activity?:
StuySSI serves as a platform for students within the Stuyvesant Community to connect with local elementary schools, fostering valuable relationships. Our main objective is to assist with tutoring, homework help, and the distribution of toys to enhance the learning experience. During club meetings, student groups will be established and paired with elementary schools. These groups commit to weekly tutoring sessions, where they help tutor and assist younger students after school hours on designated days. In addition to tutoring, our members actively participate in fundraising activities. The funds collected play a crucial role in obtaining educational toys, which we then distribute to the recipient schools. These toys play a fun and engaging role in the learning process for elementary students, igniting curiosity and enthusiasm.  Overall, students will be tasked with giving back to local communities to encourage and build stronger students for the future as well as letting kids enjoy childhood with toys they may not have had access to.

How does this activity benefit Stuyvesant?:
StuySSI acts as a catalyst for good change within the Stuyvesant Community, initiating a circle of meaningful activities. This project provides Stuyvesant students with a unique chance to make a concrete difference in their local communities. Whether it is assisting younger friends with academic activities or generously sharing toys, these behaviors foster empathy and understanding as youngsters advance on their growth journey. StuySSI's effect, however, is not limited to the children they help. The curriculum also provides participants with important life skills, such as successful leadership and effective communication. It fosters responsibility and accountability, laying a solid basis for their personal development. Participation in StuySSI instills pride in pupils as they see the immediate effects of their efforts in the lives of others. This sense of success, along with newly gained abilities, shapes well-rounded individuals who are prepared to face future difficulties with confidence. In short, the benefits of StuySSI extend beyond the students who are actively involved in the effort; they pervade the entire community. This intertwined link allows students to grow and thrive while also making a good impact on the people around them. It reflects a symbiotic relationship in which everyone triumphs and students gain critical life skills during this transforming journey. The Stuyvesant Community grows into a dynamic atmosphere where collaborative efforts drive improvement thanks to StuySSI.

How does this activity appoint leaders?:
There are 2 co-presidents in charge of the club with full authority.  They are able to appoint and designate smaller roles within the club as they see fit in order to ensure everything runs smoothly.  This includes creating board members or designated group leaders for each group of students that goes to the elementary school.

To transfer leadership, the presidents are allowed to choose the next year's presidents. They will choose who they truly believe to be the best fit for the position. Regarding impeachment protocols, if 10% of the club comes forward to begin the impeachment trial, a meeting will be held to discuss whether or not that co-president should stay, and if the other co-president and over 2/3 majority of the club agree, the co-president on trial will be removed. This process is meant to be used only on rare occasions, as presidents will understand that whoever they choose for the following presidency must be responsible, dedicated, and an overall hard worker.

What makes this activity unique?:
Most organizations at Stuyvesant that are like us follow a trend of connecting straight to families, rather than taking advantage of the fact that these children in need of tutoring are already at an academic place, their school, and by going to schools directly, we can connect to more students. Additionally, we have made it a major point to provide the tutored students with toys, so that they can still be kids. We believe every kid deserves a childhood where they can have the toys they like, and plan to help that happen. No other club in this school holds this belief.
