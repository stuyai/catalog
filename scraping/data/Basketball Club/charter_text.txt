Mission Statement:
To provide a place for Stuyvesant students to play basketball.

What days does this organization meet?:
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday

What is the meeting schedule?:
Our meeting schedule varies throughout the year. Sometimes it can be 2-3 times in a week. Other times, we will go months without meeting.

What is the purpose of this activity?:
Stuyvesant students will meet to have an opportunity to play basketball under the supervision of the coach of the Stuyvesant Boys Varsity Basketball Team otherwise known as the Stuyvesant Storm. Students will play full court, 5v5 games on a high school regulation sized court while following high school regulation rules. Occasionally, scoring rules will be adapted to make games reach their finish within a quicker time frame. Doing this allows more Stuyvesant students to practice their basketball skills. Sometimes, while a student is waiting for a chance to play, they will dribble a basketball on the side of the court in order to improve their ball handling and dribbling skills. Students will use a mens basketball provided by the Stuyvesant Boys Varsity Basketball Team, but will be required to bring their own athletic attire and appropriate basketball sneakers. Shorts are recommended but not required. The Stuyvesant Basketball Club is a fun place for all.

How does this activity benefit Stuyvesant?:
A basketball club at Stuyvesant High School brings a multitude of benefits to the school community. First and foremost, it promotes physical health and well-being among students. Engaging in regular physical activity through basketball not only helps students stay fit but also fosters a sense of discipline and teamwork. It encourages healthy competition and sportsmanship, instilling essential life skills that go beyond the court. Moreover, a basketball club enhances the social fabric of the school. It provides a platform for students from diverse backgrounds to come together, form bonds, and create lasting friendships. These connections contribute to a more inclusive and tightly-knit school community, breaking down barriers and promoting unity. Furthermore, a successful basketball club can serve as a source of pride for the entire school. It gives students, teachers, and parents something to rally behind and support, fostering a sense of school spirit and pride. This can lead to a more positive and vibrant atmosphere throughout the school, making it a more enjoyable and fulfilling place to learn. In sum, a basketball club at Stuyvesant High School not only enriches the physical and social aspects of the school community but also contributes to a more cohesive and vibrant educational environment, ultimately benefiting students and the entire school community.

How does this activity appoint leaders?:
The leaders of the basketball club are the team captains of the Stuyvesant Boys Varsity Basketball Team, also known as the Stuyvesant Storm. The team captains are appointed every year by the coach of the Stuyvesant Boys Varsity Basketball Team. If a captain were to abuse the power allotted to them in their leadership position, the coach of the Stuyvesant Boys Varsity Basketball Team would have the power to remove the captain designation and also the designation of president of the Stuyvesant Basketball Club. Every school year, when new captains are appointed, they will become the leaders of the Stuyvesant Basketball Club. Members are expected to bring appropriate medical forms in order to play. They must receive documentation from a doctor that signifies that they are physically fit and cleared for physical activity. This helps remove liability from the school and the club in the case of any extremely unfortunate accidents.

What makes this activity unique?:
The Stuyvesant Basketball Club is the only club in the school directly associated with the Stuyvesant Boys Varsity Basketball Team meaning that the club provides the best resources (coaching, equipment, etc.) and also the highest level of competition as all members of the Stuyvesant Boys Varsity Basketball Team are also members of the Stuyvesant Basketball Club. We also are the only basketball club to receive permission to use the gym considering the supervision of our coach.
