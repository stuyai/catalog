Mission:
Stuy Media aims to create long-form content to connect the student body in meaningful, empathetic, and entertaining ways.

Meeting Schedule:
Our meeting schedule varies depending on the projects that will happen. However, we meet at least once a month to brainstorm ideas for our next project. Members will continue to stay in touch and update one another through other means of communication. Directors of various departments may hold meetings with their members to work on their respective portions of videos.
