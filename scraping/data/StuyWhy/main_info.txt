Mission:
StuyWhy aims to foster discussion between students about philosophical and psychological ideas to expand upon one's perspective of life.

Meeting Schedule:
Our meeting schedule varies throughout the year, but we plan to meet at least twice a month. In the first meeting of the month, we plan to choose a topic for the next episode, work on improving the episodes, and choose who will be participating in the next episode. We will record the next episode in the second meeting, and it may either be held in person or online. We may have another meeting to discuss topics like we do in the podcast, but it will not be uploaded.
