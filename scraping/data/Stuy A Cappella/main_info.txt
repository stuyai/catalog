Mission:
Stuyvesant A Cappella bands together the talented singers of Stuyvesant's student body, using only voices to create, arrange, and perform music.

Meeting Schedule:
We typically meet 2-3 times a week, although we decide on days together as a group to ensure everyone can attend at least once a week. We take a quick break during SING! season in order to encourage our members to participate in SING!, then resume meetings once again after SING! season is over.

Leaders:
Ethan Ma - Co-President
Alison Ren - Vice President
Adina Salant - Co-President
Aydan Ferrao - Music Director
