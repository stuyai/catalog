Mission:
The Diorama Club is a community dedicated to learning architectural styles and skills by creating depictions of real or fictional buildings.

Meeting Schedule:
The first meeting for the start of each project will be in-person. This meeting will be roughly 30 minutes. From then on, the Diorama Club hopes to schedule at least 4 online meetings a month to model digitally. These meetings will be hosted on Zoom and will likely be 30 minutes to an hour. Afterward, longer in-person meetings, also at least 4 times a month, are required to work on physical models. In-person meetings may extend to roughly two hours.

Leaders:
Ella Jiang - Founder
