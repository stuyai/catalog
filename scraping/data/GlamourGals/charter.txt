companionship, conversation, and the organizationâ€™s signature program of beauty makeovers.</p></div><div><h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 css-tt7wx8">What days does this organization

class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-zv5twm">Volunteering will occur weekly at Brookdale on Thursdays. 
There will also be additional volunteering events on some weekends and breaks. 
At-school meetings will also be held on occasional Fridays. </p></div><div><h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 css-tt7wx8">What is the purpose of this activity?</h5><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-zv5twm">GlamourGals is a nonprofit organization founded in the year 2000 with the goal of alleviating the problem of loneliness among the elderly. GlamourGals Stuyvesant Chapter will partner with a local senior home to organize and participate in regular social events such as makeovers/manicures, note/card making, bracelet making, painting, cookie decorating, flower distribution, carol singing/karaoke, etc. The Stuyvesant Chapter will also receive from the GlamourGals foundation leadership training, disposable beauty supplies, club Tshirts, and various resources and advice on working with seniors. Club members are expected to attend weekly meetings, attend leadership training, participate in events hosted by the club, and engage with seniors at their care facilities. Community service hours will be offered. The positive impact of this program is two-fold. Elderly residents who are often lonely and isolated gain a renewed sense of community and self-worth because of volunteer visits. Members develop important leadership skills, as they learn to demonstrate empathy and compassion while interacting with seniors. Over half the seniors living in residential care are not visited, we have the power to change this! </p></div><div><h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 css-tt7wx8">How does this activity benefit Stuyvesant?</h5><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-zv5twm">GlamourGals Club members gain valuable leadership skills, such as
1. Developing empathy and understanding: By engaging with elders and learning about their experiences and challenges, club members can develop empathy and a deeper understanding of the issues surrounding social isolation among older adults.
2. Creating intergenerational connections: Non-profit clubs focused on elder care often provide opportunities for intergenerational connections between youth and older adults. This can help bridge the generation gap and promote mutual learning and understanding.
3. Learning new skills: GlamourGals offers regular leadership training workshops on topics such as communication skills, networking, and conflict resolution. These skills can be valuable in both personal and professional settings.
4. Promoting volunteerism: GlamourGals events help foster a spirit of service and encourage members to give back to their communities.
5. Making a tangible impact: By participating in non-profit clubs focused on elder care, members can make a tangible impact on the lives of older adults in their community. A significant portion of seniors living in care facilities do not receive any visitors which can be incredibly lonely. This can be a rewarding experience that provides a sense of purpose and accomplishment.
6. Building a sense of community: By joining a non-profit club, a student can meet and connect with like-minded peers who share similar interests and values. This can create a sense of community and belonging, which can be especially important for students who may feel isolated or disconnected.
7. Developing leadership skills: GlamourGals club will offer opportunities for students to take on leadership roles, such as serving as Vice President, Treasurer and, Public Relations Officer. These experiences can help students develop important skills such as communication, decision-making, and problem-solving. These are life skills.
8. Gaining practical experience: Members will have the opportunity to gain practical experience in areas such as event planning, community outreach, fundraising. This can be valuable experience for future career or volunteer opportunities.
9. Making a positive impact: GlamourGals is focused on community service and social justice, this provides students with a sense of purpose and the opportunity to make a positive impact in their community or the world.
10. Enhancing college applications: Participating in events can demonstrate a student's commitment to their community and their ability to work collaboratively with others. This can be a valuable addition to college applications and can help students stand out to admissions committees.
11. Service Hours: Members are awarded service hours for attending club meetings, event participation, and writing journals.</p></div><div><h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 css-tt7wx8">How does this activity appoint leaders?</h5><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-zv5twm">Critical leadership positions include President, Vice President, Public Relations Officer, Treasurer. Members seeking leadership roles will be asked to submit an application to the President of the club for review and appointment. An officer can be removed from their position if they are found to be violating the Stuyvesant constitution or student handbook rules. An officer can be removed from their position if they are found to be ineffective in carrying out their responsibilities. If the president is being impeached, the school advisor will preside over the impeachment.
In the event a leadership role opens up, a democratic election takes place at the next club meeting. Candidates vying for an open position each have the opportunity of introducing themselves, share their vision for the club, what they can contribute to the club and describe any organization-specific comments that the existing leadership would like them to make. Then they take questions from the rest of the club. The president will be the moderator for such events. Upon conclusion of each election, hand written ballots will be submitted.</p></div><div><h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 css-tt7wx8">What makes this activity unique?</h5><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-zv5twm">The primary objective of GlamourGals is to tackle the issue of elder loneliness. This problem is a significant challenge that affects many seniors worldwide, and GlamourGals has identified it as a priority. Efforts are aimed at not only addressing the physical needs of seniors, but also their emotional needs by providing companionship and conversation. 

GlamorGals has been making a positive difference in the lives of seniors since its inception in 2000. This organization stands out from other similar entities due to its unique approach and commitment to its cause.
