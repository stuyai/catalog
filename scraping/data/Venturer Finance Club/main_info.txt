Mission:
A finance club that combines business and writing to provide students with the skillsets necessary to run a start-up.

Meeting Schedule:
Meetings are typically held every two times a week, but meeting days are flexible and depend on member availability. Each meeting consists of a finance-related lesson, followed by designated time for researching relevant business news for meeting reports/articles. Articles are uploaded to the club folder, converted to a one-pager, and posted on our Instagram spotlights and club website. In place of a normal lesson, the club may occasionally host speaker panels, consulting case studies, and/or investment competitions.
