How does this activity appoint leaders?:
The leadership positions consist of Co-presidents, Vice President, Secretary, Social Media Manager(s), and Events Coordinator(s). The appointment of leaders will be conducted through a fair process. Interested members can submit their applications or express interest in the leadership positions. The applications will then be reviewed by the current leaders for the selection process. The selection of leaders will be based on various factors, including but not limited to, the applicant's commitment to the club, relevant skills and experience, leadership potential, and dedication to the organization's mission and goals. Candidates may be invited for an interview to assess their suitability for the leadership positions. The interview panel may consist of current leaders or faculty advisors. In cases where multiple candidates are equally qualified for a leadership position, a voting process can be conducted among the general members. Each member will have the opportunity to cast their vote for a candidate. The candidate with the majority of votes will be appointed to the position. If two candidates are incredibly valuable to the leadership position, they can be co-leaders. The term of leadership positions will typically be for one school year. At the end of each year, a transition process will be initiated to transfer leadership responsibilities to the newly appointed leaders. If there is any general discontent among members about certain leaders due to unfairness or any abuse, then the members can report to anybody on the leadership board or the faculty advisor. That person would then be demoted or kicked out of the club based on the severity of the abuse(s).
