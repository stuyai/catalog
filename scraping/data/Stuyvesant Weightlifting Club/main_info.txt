Mission:
We seek to educate and inspire students to begin or improve their journeys in weightlifting and fitness.

Meeting Schedule:
We will meet at least once per week in the Stuy weight room, and hopefully, we will be able to meet there twice per week or more as the school year progresses. We can also hold meetings outside of the weight room, such as running days, if they are in demand.
