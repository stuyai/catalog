Mission:
Exploring different fields of science, competing and bonding with others, and training the next winners of the National Science Bowl!

Meeting Schedule:
Our meeting schedule will be on Tuesday and Thursday. This is to give more members an opportunity to attend a meeting by offering a variety of meeting dates. It is not necessary to attend any meetings, but it is recommended for members to attend as much as they can since it will improve the club experience.
