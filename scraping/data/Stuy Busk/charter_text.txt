Mission Statement:
Stuy Busk strives to bring the joy of music to every corner of New York City, all while utilizing any funds received for charitable purposes.

What days does this organization meet?:
Friday

What is the meeting schedule?:
Our meeting schedule will be flexible to accommodate time constraints. However, we are committed to holding meetings at least once a month, and as performance dates approach, we anticipate having 2-3 meetings per week.

What is the purpose of this activity?:
With the aim of spreading the joy of music throughout communities across New York City, Stuy Busk is driven by three primary goals. (1) Firstly, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, musicians have experienced isolation due to social distancing and the inability to gather in person. The initial objective of Stuy Busk is to establish a platform for talented musicians from Stuyvesant High School to showcase their talent. (2) Secondly, Stuy Busk's secondary goal is not only to present musical performances but also to contribute positively to their community through music. The organization plans to donate funds to local charities, with the beneficiaries being determined on a monthly basis. (3) Thirdly, the ultimate aspiration of Stuy Busk is to foster courage among musicians by providing them with exposure to street performances in the vibrant setting of New York City. Members are actively encouraged to perform at designated locations and participate in club rehearsals where arrangements will be developed. This offers them a chance to learn from fellow musicians and gain confidence in performing wherever their musical journeys may lead them.

How does this activity benefit Stuyvesant?:
Stuy Busk stands to be a beacon of community engagement within the Stuyvesant High School community, with the blend of music and charity. This program, driven by its three core objectives, is uniquely positioned to give back to the Stuyvesant community in meaningful and enduring ways. 

Foremost, Stuy Busk's commitment to spotlighting local musical talent casts a spotlight on the artistic talents of Stuyvesant High School musicians. By offering them a platform to showcase their creativity, the program not only enhances the school's cultural fabric but also fosters a sense of shared pride among students, teachers, and families. This collaboration has the potential to forge lasting connections and inspire a supportive network that transcends the realm of music. 

In terms of community impact, Stuy Busk's dedication to channeling all busking proceeds into charitable funds has the power to enact tangible change. By selecting different local charities on a monthly basis, the program enables its participants to actively participate in decision-making processes that directly benefit their community. This democratic approach promotes empathy, civic engagement, and a heightened sense of responsibility towards the well-being of others, creating a culture of giving that extends far beyond the musical performances themselves. 

Lastly, the program's emphasis on street performances and rehearsals not only nurtures musical abilities but also cultivates an environment of collaboration and personal growth. This holistic approach equips participants with skills that transcend the stage, nurturing self-confidence, effective communication, and teamworkâ€”attributes that are invaluable in both artistic endeavors and everyday life.

How does this activity appoint leaders?:
Leaders will be selected based on their dedication to the club and their active involvement. Additional leadership positions will be open to all members, and the selection process will be carried out through an application form devised by the leaders. As for our members, while attending every performance is not obligatory, those who do are expected to participate in the rehearsals leading up to the performance. While members may not sign up for every single performance, we highly encourage them to do so as it will contribute to the enhancement of their performance skills.

In instances of inappropriate behavior or insufficient commitment, a well-defined procedure is in place. Initially, any concerns will be addressed by the leaders for resolution. Should the issue persist, the matter can be escalated to a club-wide vote, involving all members. This process holds the potential for the removal of a leader from their position. This framework ensures that leaders remain accountable and steadfastly aligned with the fundamental values of the club.

What makes this activity unique?:
Stuy Busk stands out due to its distinct focus on contributing to the community through music and charitable contributions. Beyond its goal of nurturing the artistic development of individual musicians through street performances across New York City, the program uniquely directs all proceeds generated from busking activities towards charitable initiatives. By harmonizing artistic expression with philanthropy, Stuy Busk not only empowers musicians to flourish but also channels the entirety of its earnings into meaningful charitable endeavors, embodying a truly exceptional and purpose-driven approach.
