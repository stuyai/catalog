Mission:
The Youth Engineering Studio (YES) strives to immerse younger students in the world of engineering through hands-on learning opportunities.

Meeting Schedule:
During the school year, studio sessions with younger students will likely occur once every other week on Sundays, unless members are available to plan and schedule more. During the summer, studio sessions can become more frequent if enough members from the schools are able to organize and attend them. Stuyvesantâ€™s Youth Engineering Studio members will meet weekly on Mondays or Thursdays (or whenever most members are available) throughout the school year to brainstorm content and prepare for each session of the cycle. Other schools are free to schedule their own meetings accordingly.
