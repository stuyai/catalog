Mission Statement:
Our mission is to empower and educate students to advocate for human rights, equality, and universal education in the U.S. and globally.

What days does this organization meet?:
Friday

What is the meeting schedule?:
The club will meet every Thursday from 3:45 - 4:45 pm to discuss:
Girls' education in developing countries, gender equity, advocacy work, current events, cultural awareness, guest speakers, leadership development, reflection and goal-setting, and collaboration with other clubs and organizations.

What is the purpose of this activity?:
The purpose of having a GLI Club is to provide a platform for students to learn about and advocate for gender equality and girls' education on a global scale. Through this club, students are able to connect with other like-minded individuals and work together to raise awareness about the importance of girls' education and the obstacles that girls face in accessing education in different parts of the world.

GLI members are expected to be active learners, keeping up with the latest developments in the field of girls' education and staying informed about the challenges and opportunities that exist in different parts of the world. This may involve reading and discussing relevant articles, attending conferences and workshops, and engaging with experts and practitioners in the field.

GLI members are also expected to be active participants in the broader Stuyvesant community, working to promote gender equality and girls' education in our own school and beyond. This may involve organizing awareness-raising campaigns, participating in community service initiatives, and collaborating with other student groups (i.e. Girl Up, Rock the Street Wall Street, GlamourGals) or activities (i.e. Stuyvesant International Women's Day Run) to promote gender equity and social justice.

Overall, the purpose of the GLI club at Stuyvesant High School is to provide students with an opportunity to engage in meaningful and impactful work that contributes to the global movement for gender equality and girls' education. By joining this club, students are able to connect with other like-minded individuals, learn about the challenges and opportunities in the field, and take action to promote change and create a better world for all.

How does this activity benefit Stuyvesant?:
A Girls Learn International (GLI) club will benefit the Stuyvesant community in several ways. These include:

1. Raising awareness about the importance of girls' education and the obstacles that girls face in accessing education in different parts of the world.

2. Connecting students with other like-minded individuals who share their passion for promoting gender equity and girls' education, fostering a sense of community and belonging.

3. Engaging students in advocacy work to support girls' education projects in different countries, providing them with a sense of purpose and agency.

4. Developing important skills, such as leadership, communication, and teamwork, which can be valuable in a range of settings.

5. Cultivating important character traits, such as resilience, grit, and compassion, which can be important for success in both academic and personal domains.

6. Providing students with a global perspective and an understanding of different cultures and ways of life, which can be especially important in an increasingly interconnected and diverse world.

7. Developing cross-cultural communication skills: By learning about the challenges faced by girls in different countries, students can develop a greater appreciation for cultural differences and learn how to communicate effectively with people from different backgrounds.

8. Building self-confidence: By taking an active role in promoting girls' education, students can develop a sense of pride and self-confidence in their abilities to make a positive impact on the world around them.

9. Creating networking opportunities: GLI clubs provide students with the opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals who may become valuable contacts in the future. These connections can be especially helpful when pursuing academic or career opportunities related to girls' education and gender equity.

A GLI club benefits high school students by providing opportunities to learn, connect, and take action to promote gender equity and girls' education. Students can develop important skills and character traits, while also gaining a global perspective that can be invaluable in the 21st century.

How does this activity appoint leaders?:
Critical leadership positions include President, Vice President, and a Public Relations Officer. Members seeking leadership roles will be asked to submit an application to the President of the club for review and appointment. An officer can be removed from his or her position if she or she is found to be violating the Stuyvesant constitution or student handbook rules. An officer can be removed from his or her position if he or she is found to be ineffective in carrying out his or her responsibilities. If the president is being impeached, the school advisor will preside over the impeachment.

In the event a leadership role opens up, a democratic election takes place at the next club meeting. Candidates vying for an open position each have the opportunity of introducing themselves, share their vision for the club, what they can contribute to the club and describe any organization-specific comments that the existing leadership would like them to make. Then they take questions from the rest of the club. The president will be the moderator for such events. Upon conclusion of each election, hand written ballots will be submitted.

What makes this activity unique?:

1. Focus on global issues: Unlike many other clubs, GLI clubs focus on global issues related to girls' education and gender equity, providing students with a unique perspective on world events.
