Mission:
Stuy Proteomics strives to foster a love for biology beyond the scope of the classroom, with a focus on 3-D protein models and biology research.

Meeting Schedule:
Meetings will be held once a week, though they may be held more often in the weeks approaching the symposium or other major events. The club takes a vote at the beginning of each semester to decide which day of the week works best for everyone.
