Mission:
Stuy Survey Services aims to uncover the opinions of the student body through periodic surveys on a diverse range of topics.

Meeting Schedule:
As a low commitment club, we will host about three meetings a month, with a new survey being a topic of every meeting. During exam season, there will be up to two meetings per month instead. Meetings will be relatively short, thirty to forty-five minutes. Meetings will be in person, usually on the fourth floor.

Leaders:
Ethan Chen - Co-President
