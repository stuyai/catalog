Mission:
Practice public speaking while strengthening persuasion skills, thinking on the spot, professional vocabulary, legal argumentation!

Meeting Schedule:
The days we are going to meet are still to be determined, but will likely include Tuesday, or Wednesday and a day over the weekend on zoom. On some occasions, after school practice will be held at the office of our sponsor law firm. This will ensure that members are often able to come to both meetings, as we understand many are busy over weekdays. Our meeting schedule will usually ramp up before the competition season which takes place around February each year, but meetings will be once or twice a week. This is a fall semester activity meaning we will only be having meetings during the first semester.
