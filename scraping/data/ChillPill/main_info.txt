Mission:
Chill Pill aims to foster a judgment-free safe space for students to share their experiences whilst addressing and learning about mental health.

Meeting Schedule:
Chill Pill aims to meet 3 times a month, but it is flexible depending on membersâ€™ availability. For now, these meetings will be held both in person or virtually through zoom, and the type will be decided based on availability as well. In-person meetings are aimed to be held at 3:50 pm and virtual meetings at later in the day, like 6 pm, to ensure our members can get home without any feelings of being rushed.

Leaders:
Talia Cheng - Creator
Fang Jian Ye Fang Wu - Vice President
Sangam Bhati - President in Training
