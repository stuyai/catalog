What is the purpose of this activity?:
Spikeball is an up and coming sport that is often played between friends at the beach or at a park. However, it is competitive like any other sport. The club will have meetings every month that every member is encouraged to come to, where we will explain the rules to people with no prior experience and those who know how to play can play against any team they want. We will be hosting tournaments often where we will see who truly is the best player. As a member of this club, respect for fellow members is paramount. Everyone, regardless of skill level, deserves a positive and encouraging atmosphere. Good sportsmanship is the name of the game. Actively participate in club activities, whether it's regular playing sessions, tournaments, or club events. Your involvement contributes to the overall success and vibrancy of the club. Members are encouraged to bring ideas and suggestions to the table. Whether it's organizing events, proposing new activities, or helping with club logistics, your input is valued.

How does this activity appoint leaders?:
In spikeball club, choosing and changing leaders is a straightforward process. Most leadership positions have already been decided, but if their involvement in the club starts to lack, they will be likely be replaced by a more involved and active member, who obviously is willing to take on the responsibility the role comes with.
If someone isn't quite meeting expectations, there's an impeachment process. Members share their concerns, and if others in leadership positions recognize and understand their concerns, therefore deeming the member not fit for the position, they step down. Between school years, if those in leadership positions are leaving the school, a member, appointed by the other leaders of the club will step up and fill their position. There may be different leadership roles involving logistics, money, and overall presidents. Efficiency and clear decisions guide the club's dynamics. It's a smooth process, ensuring the club stays on course with leaders who resonate with the vibe, and players who share the love for the game.

What makes this activity unique?:

Unlike traditional sports clubs, spikeball is inclusive and doesn't require extensive training or a specific skill set. This makes it appealing to a broad range of students, fostering a diverse and welcoming community. The game's simplicity and portability contribute to its distinctiveness. Set up can happen virtually anywhere, from the school courtyard to the grassy quad, promoting spontaneous and informal play.
