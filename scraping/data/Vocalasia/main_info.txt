Mission:
The mission is to share the love for Asian music through live and Youtube vocal cover performances.

Meeting Schedule:
Meeting schedules will be decided based on membersâ€™ availability (a form will be sent out). Each individual language will also have its own practice schedule; as of now there are three main languages (Chinese, Korean, Japanese), so there will be one meeting per week for each of those languages. Those who sign up to be in the group for a specific language will come to that meeting. Members are encouraged to apply to as many languages as they want and to suggest new languages that they think other students would like to add. In addition, there will also be a karaoke meeting once a month for everyone to gather and sing. All meeting activities will also be recorded and updated live in a spreadsheet. At the end of each project period, there will be a showcase where members can show off what they have recorded to the rest of the club. During the annual SOS showcase at the end of the year, members will also split into three groups (one for each language) and will have different practice days.
