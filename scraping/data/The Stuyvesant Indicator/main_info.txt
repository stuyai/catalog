Mission:
The Indicator, Stuyvesantâ€™s senior yearbook, intends to produce a special collection of memories for the graduating seniors.

Meeting Schedule:
Though there are few meetings for Indicator as a whole, departmental meetings are up to the respective department editors to coordinate. For select departments, teaching days will be hosted to familiarize staff members with certain skills. Members of the Indicator will also have the opportunity to meet one another and collaborate on assignments!
