Mission:
To teach students financial literacy and institute a wealth mindset to set them up for future financial success.

Meeting Schedule:
Our club will meet once a week. Club meetings will be very informal and held on every other Wednesday, from 3:35-5 PM. The club is low-commitment and wonâ€™t require members to attend every meeting. Club members who have meetings in other clubs can arrive at any time in between the specified period and can stay for as long as they want.
