Mission:
Aspire is a program aiming to help students experience a better transition from middle school to high school

Meeting Schedule:
Aspire will meet at least once a week, but if we are particularly busy, we will arrange extra meetings in advance.

 Ideally, we want to hold meetings on Tuesday or Friday. It is ideal to hold meetings on Tuesdays for the debate club members. People also won't have to worry about their schoolwork on Fridays.

Leaders:
Pei Yuan Yang - Creator
Galvin Chen - Leader
