Mission:
We aim to provide an environment and community for students to immerse themselves in the creating and learning choreography.

Meeting Schedule:
We plan to meet at least once or twice a month, but more meetings can be added based on how many people there are who want to share choreography. More meetings can also be added if we are able to collaborate with other organizations or clubs to host events or charity fundraiser classes.

Leaders:
Lorraine Li
Ajolia Cheung
