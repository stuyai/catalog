Competitive or casual, let's have a good time. 
Here, being a good person comes before being a good athlete!</p></div><div><h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 css-tt7wx8">What days does this organization meet?</h5><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-zv5twm">Friday, Thursday, Wednesday, Monday</p></div><div><h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 css-tt7wx8">What is the meeting schedule?</h5><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-zv5twm">Our meeting schedule will vary through the year, especially as the weather gets colder before more outdoor-friendly, but eventually, we plan to meet at least twice a week.</p></div><div><h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 css-tt7wx8">What is the purpose of this activity?</h5><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-zv5twm">Our goal is to provide a place for casual and competitive people who want to learn or play pickleball, all in a relaxed, team environment. With a low commitment, this is a club for people who want a place to relax and be active with friends, as well as students who want to get competitive and be active in a more serious way. We have materials to facilitate pickleball playing for a full club, including paddles, nets, and maintenance supplies. 



Additionally, the club leaders can bring the club to public courts available in parks around the city, to engage with the community and play as a team. Stuy Pickle also has extensive knowledge concerning the sport, sufficient for teaching aspiring pickleballers and helping learned athletes get better.

Whether you want to relax after school and find a fun sport for the latter half of your year, or you really want to see how good you can get at pickleball, this is an open and accepting club that would love to have your membership.

We basically go to parks and play pickleball, the club leaders have paddles and nets, you can hang out or play, do whatever!</p></div><div><h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 css-tt7wx8">How does this activity benefit Stuyvesant?</h5><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-zv5twm">A pickleball club at Stuy could bring with it numerous benefits for our community. Firstly, pickleball is a sport that promotes physical activity and social interaction. The club would offer students an enjoyable way to stay active, fostering a healthier lifestyle among participants. It's a sport that is accessible to players of various skill levels, making it inclusive and appealing to a wide range of students.

Moreover, a pickleball club can contribute to the development of important life skills. Teamwork, communication, and sportsmanship are inherent aspects of playing pickleball, providing students with opportunities to enhance their interpersonal skills. Additionally, organizing and participating in club activities can help students develop leadership skills as they take on roles such as team captain, event organizer, or club officer.

Beyond the physical and social aspects, a pickleball club can create a sense of community within the high school. It offers a platform for students with similar interests to come together, fostering friendships and a supportive network. This sense of community can extend beyond the court, positively influencing the overall atmosphere of the school.

In summary, a pickleball club would benefit your high school community by promoting physical health, enhancing interpersonal and leadership skills, and fostering a sense of community among students.

</p></div><div><h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 css-tt7wx8">How does this activity appoint leaders?</h5><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-zv5twm">There are a couple main leadership positions.
Those who demonstrate skill in leading and pickleball will be in charge of advanced groups and lead practices for the more competitive crowd
Of those who demonstrate the ability or desire to play well and could teach will be designated to leading and teaching less advanced or serious groups who want to learn or play more casually.
There will be leaders of teams, and leaders will be responsible on a rotating basis for constructing new practice schedules for the club.

Beyond the athletic side of things, In the envisioned pickleball club, leadership positions would be crucial for the effective organization and operation of the club. The club could have positions such as President, Vice President, Secretary, and Event Coordinator. The President would typically oversee the overall functioning of the club, ensuring that its goals and activities align with the interests of its members and the school community.

The Vice President would support the President and step in when needed, working collaboratively to execute club initiatives. The Secretary would be responsible for maintaining records, documenting meetings, and handling communication within the club. An Event Coordinator would plan and execute various activities, tournaments, and social events related to pickleball.

These leadership positions could be appointed through a combination of nominations and elections. Interested students would nominate themselves or be nominated by their peers, followed by a democratic voting process among club members. This approach ensures that individuals with a genuine passion for pickleball and strong leadership qualities are entrusted with guiding the club toward success. The appointment process should prioritize inclusivity and encourage diverse representation within the leadership team to cater to the varied interests and needs of the club members.</p></div><div><h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 css-tt7wx8">What makes this activity unique?</h5><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-zv5twm">What's unique about Stuy Pickle is that we are simultaneously providing a place for those interested and competitive in pickleball, as well as those less inclined, whether they are casual, learning, or just want to hang out and be around those playing. 
Additionally, we are a club making use of NYC's abundant resources, specifically the multitude of public pickleball courts free to everybody set up in the city's beautiful parks. We offer students at Stuy a way to dive into the community and resources that are NYC, all while getting out in the sun and being active.
We are casual, with members and leaders who want to have a good time and relax with their friends away from the stress at Stuy, but we are also competitive, with just as many members eager to bring their A-game and find out how to get better, as well as teach what they know/discover to anybody with a desire to be learn.</p></div><div><h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 css-tt7wx8">Anything else?</h5><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-zv5twm">Our club will be active, and will not be a place where exclusivity or unkindness are allowed to fester. The goal here, besides pickleball, is to relieve stress after a lot of time being under pressure at stuy. More than this, however, we want to create a good environment where connections can be formed and strengthened between fellow students and friends. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
