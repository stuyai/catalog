Mission:
The Stuy Martial Arts Club aims to teach self defense techniques and allow students to practice, learn, or teach different forms of martial arts.

Meeting Schedule:
We meet almost every Thursday at a local dojo/dojang, usually meeting at the bridge and walking there at around 3:50-4. We have the space from 4:15-5:15. Leaders will also sometimes hold meetings in school after 10th around the 3rd-4th floors, usually Mondays or Fridays. Competitions will be held independently of these meetings.
