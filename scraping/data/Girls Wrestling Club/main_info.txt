Mission:
The Girls Wrestling Club is meant to empower young women through the art of wrestling since Stuy currently doesn't have a girls' wrestling team.

Meeting Schedule:
Our meeting schedule will vary depending on available space, but we will meet at least once a month.

Zoe Chin - Co-President & Creator
Ushoshi Das - Co-Captain & Co-Founder
